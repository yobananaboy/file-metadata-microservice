Matt's file metadata microservice
=================================

A simple service for uploading files to view their size in bytes. Also returns the file name and file type.

Example output
--------------

```
{
  "filename": <the name of the file>,
  "size": <size of the file in bytes>,
  "type": <the filetype>
}
```
